# earthSandwich

// A way to see where the opposite side of the earth is to you.

// Earth sandwich works from Ze Franks old challenge, where you have to place of bread on opposite sides of the earth to make the most accurate sandwich. This calculator and map makes that part easy, co-ordintating your friend or travel plans on the other hand is not as simple

// Most recent update got leaflet working in node using vite. See the folder 'Leaflet_Node_and_Geoapify' if you want to run it

// Next step is to add geoCoding to allow address lookups as lat/long inputs are not a great user experience.
